# Network Vitals: AWS Infrastructure Foundation

## Overview
This phase focuses on building secure, resilient network infrastructure on AWS. Learn fundamental security concepts through hands-on labs covering VPC design, EC2 hardening, high availability patterns, and multi-tier architectures.

## Labs Included

### Days 01-02: Setup & Architecture
- AWS account setup and security hardening
- VPC architecture with public/private subnet isolation
- Route tables and internet gateway configuration

### Days 03-05: Compute & Identity
- EC2 instance deployment and vulnerability assessment
- IAM governance and identity management
- Zero Trust VPC implementation

### Days 06-07: Connectivity & Availability
- Egress-only connectivity with NAT Gateways
- Bastion host configuration
- Multi-AZ high availability web tier

### Days 08-09: Resilient Architecture
- Self-healing website deployment
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) configuration
- Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) for elasticity
- 3-tier architecture implementation

## Key Technologies
- **AWS VPC** - Virtual Private Cloud networking
- **EC2** - Elastic Compute Cloud instances
- **IAM** - Identity and Access Management
- **ALB** - Application Load Balancer
- **ASG** - Auto Scaling Groups
- **NAT Gateway** - Network Address Translation

## Security Principles
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Defense in depth
- Least privilege access
- High availability and fault tolerance
