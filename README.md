# 🛡️ Cloud-Security-Engine-180
> **From Vulnerability Management to Cloud Security Architecture**

## 🎯 The Mission
To transition from a traditional **Vulnerability & Threat Management** specialist to a **Cloud Security Engineer** within 180 days. This repository serves as a living portfolio of my technical journey, focusing on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **Security Automation**, and **Defensive Cloud Architecture**.

In 2026, finding vulnerabilities is easy—remediating them at scale is where the value lies. My goal is to master the "Self-Healing Cloud" by building automated guardrails that prevent misconfigurations before they occur.
