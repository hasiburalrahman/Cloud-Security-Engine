### 🚀 Completed Labs

#### 🌐 Phase 1: Infrastructure & Networking Foundation
* **Day 01-02:** **Setup & Hardening / VPC Architecture**
    * Designed a multi-tier VPC with public/private subnet isolation and Route Table management.
* **Day 03-05:** **Compute Hardening & Zero Trust**
    * Implemented EC2 security hardening, vulnerability assessments, and Identity Remediation.
* **Day 06-07:** **High Availability & Connectivity**
    * Configured NAT Gateways for egress-only connectivity and built a Multi-AZ web architecture.
* **Day 08-09:** **Resilient Architecture**
    * Deployed a **Highly Available 3-Tier Architecture** using **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** and **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**.

#### 🤖 Phase 2: Serverless AI & Identity
* **Day 10-11:** **AI Image Intelligence**
    * Built a serverless system using **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon Rekognition** for automated facial comparison.
* **Day 12-13:** **The Identity Vault: Serverless Biometric Authentication**
    * Engineered **Least-Privilege IAM Policies** to restrict service-to-service communication.
    * Integrated **Amazon DynamoDB** to maintain an automated audit trail of access attempts.

### 🔒 Security Principles Applied
1. **Least Privilege:** All IAM roles are restricted to specific Resource ARNs.
2. **Attack Surface Reduction:** Private Subnets and NAT Gateways prevent direct internet exposure.
3. **Auditability:** 100% of identity verification attempts are logged for incident response.
